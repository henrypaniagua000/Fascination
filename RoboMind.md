I think RoboMind has some really good info about moving robots because this can help people/me how to program 
or how to make your robot move, it also shows you the up,down,left, and right keys and from this I think that 
the important thing that I gained was that it is actually easy (some may not) and I remember I used to not know what to do, to
program my robot and I am now kind of getting used to it
